# The payment window is PhoenixMail's

Wire's page (`internal/web/static/index.html`) opens **PhoenixMail's own payment window**, mirrored from PhoenixMail
`6d2b3b6` into `internal/web/static/pm/`: `nimiq-payments.js`, `usdt-payments.js`, `usdt-cashlink.js`, `nimiq-hub.js`,
`phoenix-nimiq.js`, `nimiq-iqons.js` and the styles `app.css`, `nimiq-payments.css`, `theme-light.css`.
Those files are the owner's own code (MIT in this repository), mirrored, not rewritten.

What is Wire's (and only that):

- `wire-pay.js`: who the sender is (e-mail code), the window's host options, and what happens after a card is made:
  the browser keeps the claim link, watches the card, and once it is funded asks Wire to e-mail the recipient
  (`/api/usdt/card/<id>/invite`, the claim link is checked against the card and never stored).
- `internal/wire/usdt_compat.go`: the routes the window calls, in PhoenixMail's shape (`/api/usdt/status`,
  `/api/usdt/cashlink/{create,status,cancel,refund,refund-claim,gas-status,gas}`), each answered by the gateway's
  own USDC / USDT card logic behind the sender's session. The QR of the payment link is drawn on the server.

Three small, marked changes to the mirrored files (to re-apply after a new sync):

1. `pm/nimiq-payments.js` `cardShell`: the card's emblem and name come from an `o.brand` option (PhoenixMail's by default).
2. `pm/usdt-cashlink.js` and `pm/usdt-payments.js` `sw()`: the texts say `window.PhoenixBrandName` instead of "PhoenixMail".
3. `wire-pay.css` hides what Wire's server does not do yet: NIM and "Request payment".

Not yet in this window: NIM (still `classic.html`, which a `/?claim=…` link opens) and the sender's free gas (the window
supports it; `/api/usdt/status` says `gas:false`).

## Wire navigation, identity and session copy

Wire adds an explicit return control to each payment-window instance from `wire-pay.js`. It invokes the copied window's own
close button so its listeners and observers are cleaned up. Asset switches recreate the window; a host observer enhances each
replacement. The mirrored files remain unchanged. The page also links directly to the PhoenixWire presentation
(`https://phoenixmail.ca/#phoenixwire`) and PhoenixMail (`https://phoenixmail.ca/#phoenixmail`). Classic NIM has a link back to `/`.

The tab and mobile shortcut name is PhoenixWire. Icons derive from the existing emblem; normal static routing serves them with
the existing CSP. Before sender verification and beside the signed-in address, five-language text explains the unchanged 24-hour
session. `tests/wire-pay.test.mjs` covers those labels and navigation with the copied window and fake API.

## Exact invitation boundary

The browser generates and retains the link key. It sends public owner data at card creation and proofs/signatures to claim and
refund routes. When inviting the recipient, it submits the **full claim URL** to Wire, which validates it and uses it in the mail
without persisting it. A retry may submit it again. The recipient browser does not submit its fragment to claim routes.
Do not extend that last property into a claim that Wire or its mail provider can never see the key. The transient invitation
handoff and the service co-signer are separate parts of the trust model; no runtime behavior changed in this clarification.
